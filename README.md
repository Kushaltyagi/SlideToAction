# SlideToAction
.Net MAUI provides us with bunch of cool controls for mobile app development out of the box. But these controls are quite basic in look and feel and often does not meet our UI/UX requirements. HenceÂ .NET MAUI allows us to create custom controls using handlers.
I have created one such "SlideToAction" control for both android and iOS mobile apps.
